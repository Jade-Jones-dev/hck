      LoanIt is here to help you with:

      <ul>
        1. Give things away – find a grateful neighbour for stuff you no longer
        need
      </ul>

      <ul>
        2. Share things – like ladders and drills, that go unused much of the
        time
      </ul>

      <ul>
        3. Share skills – like DIY, languages and gardening, that neighbours
        might need help with
      </ul>

      See what's in your neighbourhood. It all started in 2010, after Sam had a
      good experience of sharing with his next-door neighbours. They had been
      lending stuff to him – small stuff mainly (like a cup of sugar), but it
      got bigger (like a ladder) and in time he found he’d actually made friends
      with them. They even took the fence between their gardens down and they
      did all the gardening (result for Sam!). Watch the Streetbank story Over
      the years, Streetbank has grown to be one of the biggest neighbourhood
      sharing websites in the world, rated by the Times as one of the 50
      websites you can’t live without. Every day, people across the world are
      using the site to share stuff. From the weird and wonderful, to the
      practical and useful – but everything that’s shared is valuable in some
      way, to somebody! The result? Friendlier neighbourhoods, money saved and
      less stuff wasted and ending up in landfill. Jack’s story Jack in Oxford
      has been given grapes for wine-making, wild-swimming advice and a sewing
      machine. Patricia’s story Patricia borrowed a two-ring electric hob when
      her new kitchen was being installed, a gazeebo for a party and was given a
      mattress. Rose’s story Rose has decluttered her home – giving away old
      coats, jewellery, crafty stuff – and reconnected with an old teacher and
      made friends. You can join us and see what's in your neighbourhood in just
      a few clicks!
